### Hi, I'm Eva 👋

I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/">University of Washington Information School</a> advised by <a href="http://nicweber.info/">Dr. Nicholas Weber</a>. My research investigates the identification, measurement, and attribution of scientific software and its developers in science. My work forms connections between scientific source code and publications, examines how scientific software impacts research outcomes, and explores methods for measuring the sustainability of critical research software. My recent work includes studying <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.16242">code contribution and credit in science</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.05087">measuring software innovation through open-source development data</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.06672">identifying crucial but hidden biomedical software packages</a>.

(And sometimes I help with microscopy and civic tech software development.)

For more details about me, [see my website](https://evamaxfield.github.io).

Projects in Development:
* [rs-graph](https://github.com/evamaxfield/rs-graph) -- mining software used in science
* [sci-soft-models](https://github.com/evamaxfield/sci-soft-models) -- computational models for studies of scientific software
* [aws-grobid](https://github.com/evamaxfield/aws-grobid) -- spin up GROBID servers easily
* [pyEIL](https://github.com/evamaxfield/py-extract-imported-libraries) -- extract imported libraries (first party, third party, and stdlib) from Python and R files
* [py-nb-to-src](https://github.com/evamaxfield/py-nb-to-src) -- convert notebook formats (`.ipynb` and `.Rmd` to their script equivalents), useful for preprocessing before source code analysis with `pyEIL` or `lizard`

Outdated but Will Revist Soon:
* [papers-without-code](https://github.com/evamaxfield/papers-without-code) -- find github repos similar to research papers
* [out-and-about](https://evamaxfield.github.io/out-and-about) -- **works best on mobile + Chrome**, find the closest public bathrooms and water fountains near your location

Old Projects:
* [CouncilDataProject](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject) -- city council meeting transcripts, voting records, etc. republished for archival
  * [cookiecutter-cdp-deployment](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/cookiecutter-cdp-deployment)
  * [cdp-backend](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/cdp-backend)
  * [cdp-data](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/cdp-data)
  * [speakerbox](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/speakerbox)

Some Projects That I Used to Know:
* [AICSImageIO](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio) -- microscopy image reading in python
* [aicsimageio -> BioIO](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio) -- same but new and less dependencies and licensing oddities

I have a very opinionated [Python project template](https://github.com/evamaxfield/pyproject-template) I used for research projects, packages, etc. Minimal but it works for me.
