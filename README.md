### Hi, I'm Eva ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) working in the [UW DataLab](https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/). My research involves the collection and analysis of large-scale social and behavioral data, usually from municipal or public sources. I create and use novel machine learning methods for information extraction to answer questions related to conversation dynamics, engagement, misinformation, and understanding policy actions within public meetings.

(And sometimes I do some biology and microscopy data engineering work too.)

For more details about me, [see my website](https://evamaxfield.github.io).
