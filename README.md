### Hi, I'm Eva ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/). I use novel machine learning, natural language processing, and network analysis techniques to study the development, maintenance, and impact of research software. I am particularly interested in understanding divisions of labor and maintenance-usage imbalance in open source research software ecosystems.

(And sometimes I help with biology, microscopy, and civic tech software development.)
