### Hi, I'm Eva ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) working in the [UW DataLab](https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/). My research involves the collection and analysis of large-scale social and behavioral data, usually from municipal or public sources. I create and use novel machine learning methods for information extraction to answer questions related to conversation dynamics, engagement, misinformation, and understanding policy actions within public meetings.

For more details about me, [see my website](https://evamaxfield.github.io).
